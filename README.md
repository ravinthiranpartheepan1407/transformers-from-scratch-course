## Description

In this course, you will learn how to build Transformers from scratch, the same model that powers ChatGPT, Claude, Google Translate, and more. Transformers are the core of many powerful AI applications, and understanding how they work can help you build your own language models or text-generative AI applications. I will guide you through each step, making it easy to understand how these models function.

You will start with the basics, including the math behind Transformer stacks, and learn how to create the building blocks of a Transformer. I will cover key concepts like attention mechanisms, tokenization, and model training. No prior deep learning experience is needed, as I will explain everything in simple terms, step by step. By the end of the course, you will have the skills to create your own Transformer model from the ground up, without relying on pre-built libraries.

This course is perfect for anyone interested in deep learning and curious about the technology behind tools like GPT and Google Translate. Whether you're a beginner or looking to deepen your understanding, this course will give you a hands-on approach to building one of the most important models in modern deep learning. Letâ€™s get started and learn how to build them from scratch!
